# Car Inventory Management System

An inventory management system for automation as per the client's request.

## Features

- View inventory (Must Have)
- Add to inventory (Must Have)
- Remove from Inventory (Must Have)
- Search inventory by company, model, year, or color (Must Have)
- Automatic duplicate detection - adds to existing quantity when the same car is added (Nice to have)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas library

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
python car_inventory.py
```

2. Navigate through the menu options:
   - Option 1: View the current inventory
   - Option 2: Add cars to inventory (manually or from database)
   - Option 3: Remove cars from inventory
   - Option 4: Search inventory by various criteria
   - Option 5: Exit the application

## Data Storage

- Inventory data is stored in a CSV file named `inventory.csv`
- The dealership database is stored in a CSV file named `dealership.csv`
- Both files are created automatically if they don't exist

## Example Workflow

1. First run: The program will create empty inventory files
2. Add some cars either manually or from the dealership database
3. View inventory to see all cars
4. Search for specific cars by various criteria
5. Remove cars when they're sold or no longer available

## Notes

- The ID field is managed automatically
- When adding cars that already exist in inventory, the quantity is automatically updated
- The application automatically handles case-sensitivity in searches and data entry

## Troubleshooting

- If the application can't find the dealership database, ensure `dealership.csv` is in the same directory as the script
- If you encounter any errors reading or writing CSV files, check file permissions
