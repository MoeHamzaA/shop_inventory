# Automation Inventory System

This automated inventory system checks branded and non-branded cars in client inventory to sell or maintain.

## Client Requests for system

The client requests to add, remove, and search inventory at will. He also requested a login system for administrative use for his employees and himself. We plan to add that for Iterative 3. We also have plans to create an appealing GUI using tailwind CSS.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Navigate through the menu options:
   - Option 1: View the current inventory
   - Option 2: Add cars to inventory (manually or from the database)
   - Option 3: Remove cars from inventory
   - Option 4: Search inventory by various criteria
   - Option 5: Exit the application

## Features

Features include:
- Viewing inventory
