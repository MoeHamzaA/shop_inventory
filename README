# Automation Inventory System

This is a automation inventory system that checks branded and non-branded cars in client inventory to sell or to maintain.

## Client Requests for system

Client requests to add, remove, and to search inventory at will. He would've also like to have a login system for adminstrative use for his employees and himself. We plan to add that for Iterative 3. We also have plans to create an appealing GUI using tailwind css.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
```bash
python car_inventory.py
```

2. Navigate through the menu options:
   - Option 1: View the current inventory
   - Option 2: Add cars to inventory (manually or from database)
   - Option 3: Remove cars from inventory
   - Option 4: Search inventory by various criteria
   - Option 5: Exit the application

## Features

   Vewing inventory (Has a)
   Adding to the inventory (you can add from the database if you wish)
